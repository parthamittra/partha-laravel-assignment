# Developer test for Guild / Laravel

## Given

- You have a loan application
  - The loan application has 2 borrowers
    - One borrower has a job
    - The other borrower has a job and a bank account

## Requirements

- Clone this git repository and create a feature branch for your changes
- Install a fresh copy of Laravel
- Create some simple database tables to represent the above scenario
  - By simple I mean just the basics of what's really needed for this exercise
  - For example, the borrower should have a name, but we don't need date of birth, social security number or contact information for this exercise
  - Though I would like to see the standard date fields as part of the design (ie. created, updated, deleted)
- Write a query (or queries) that shows the total annual income and bank account values for the application
- Expose an API end point to show the results of the query (or queries)
  - All output should be in JSON format
- Write a unit test on at least one method in the project
  - I'm deliberatly keeping this requirement vague to give you freedom to decide what to test and how
- Update this README file with any installation instructions needed so we can clone and run your code
- Commit your feature branch back to this repository

## What we're looking for

- Your general skill-set with PHP and MySQL
- Your general architecture skills
