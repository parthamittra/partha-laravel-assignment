  - By simple I mean just the basics of what's really needed for this exercise

  - Though I would like to see the standard date fields as part of the design (ie. created, updated, deleted)

- Expose an API end point to show the results of the query (or queries)
  - All output should be in JSON format
- Write a unit test on at least one method in the project
  - I'm deliberatly keeping this requirement vague to give you freedom to decide what to test and how
- Update this README file with any installation instructions needed so we can clone and run your code
